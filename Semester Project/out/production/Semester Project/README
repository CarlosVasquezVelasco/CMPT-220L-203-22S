Set up of the project:
The project has four files to it. There is the counter class, Node class, BST class and the Main class.
Most of the functional code is written in the BST class. The node class was used to define the node that
will be called on when making and traversing the BST.
The counter class was made to initialize a counter object which was used in finding the Nth largest object.

To use the project, the user should interact with the Main.java file. By typing bin_tree.insert(); and inserting
a number in the parenthesis, the user is adding a node with a certain value to the binary search tree.
The function: find_element(any integer); checks to see if the desired element is in the binary search tree, and
if it is it returns a true statement. If the value is not in the binary search tree, then it returns a false statement.

All the functions that are written recursively have a respective caller function that is what is used in the main class.
The only user input needed is to enter any desired numbers into the find_element function or if they wanted to insert
more nodes to the tree. Running the main class will output all potential information.
